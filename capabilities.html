<p><b>Accessibility at the Edge Community
Group</b></p>

<p><b>Overlay Capabilities Inventory</b></p>

<p>This document describes some functionalities that can be provided "at the edge",
   and attempts to answer several questions about them.</p>

<p>The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>[2] Locating functionality in
the stack to achieve maximum benefit: Source Code Perspective</li>

<li>Is this functionality duplicated elsewhere in the stack?</li>

<li>What is the benefit of doing this at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics</li>
</ul>

<h1>Inventory</h1>

<h2>User-triggered interaction/opt-in</h2>

<p>User opt-ins via interactive. Personalization.
The end-user can turn on those enhancements that help them</p>

<p>[2] Sites may offer, at source
code level, user-triggered interactions, rather than offering them in a
JavaScript layer.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Many enhancements such as
contrast are available on the operating system level.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Runs automatically, no user action needed</h2>

<p>Overlay capabilities that run on
the page, without any action needed by the end-user.</p>

<h2>Portable cross-site profile expressing accessibility-oriented preferences</h2>

<p>Portable profile expressing
accessibility-oriented preferences, that can be presented by the end-user (via
the overlay) to tailor a website's experience to the user's preferences.</p>

<h2>Automated Detection</h2>

<p>Algorithmic detection of
violations of WCAG 2.x success critera. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> In-browser scanners, online scanners
perform detection. A large number of companies do this too for a fee.</dd>

<dt>Related Topics:</dt>
<dd> False positives, false
negatives; certainty</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Automated Remediation</h2>

<p>Remediation of a violation of a
WCAG 2.x success critera by programmatic means.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Remediating at source, by hand</dd>

<dt>Related Topics:</dt>
<dd>False positives, false
negatives</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Notifications</h2>

<p>Messages shown to the end-user to
alert the user to an event, information or a state. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Related Topics:</dt>
<dd>What is required to disclose
to the user?</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Human in the loop on automated remediation suggestions</h2>

<p>Overlay owner is asked to accept
programmatic suggestions. This enables democratization of accessibility tasks
and acceleration.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Accessibility provider visibly displayed </h2>

<p>Display to website users the name
of the primary accessibility provider, who stands behind the accessibility of
the site, offering transparency. This may be part of the accessibility
statement.</p>

<p>[2] The provider can be listed in
the source text.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. Sometimes (rarely) the accessibilty provider
is mentioned in the accessibility statement or accessibility policy. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Accessibility statement access</h2>

<p>A link to the site's accessibility
statement</p>

<p>[2] The link can be hosted on the
source page.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> The link in the footer of the
site</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Accessibility issue reporting</h2>

<p>A form, or email link, enabling
end-users to report barriers to accessibility to the website owner</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Contact us in the
accessibility statement</dd>

<dt>Related Topics:</dt>
<dd> Responsibility for responding.
Requires that the company receiving the report has expertise to respond. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Profile enabling a bundle of user-triggered interactions/opt-ins (on a
site)</h2>

<p>Optional profiles that group
interactive features together into bundles, making it easier to turn on groups
of features, e.g. high contrast and larger text size.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Accessibility editing, by site owner</h2>

<p>An interface in the overlay,
available to authorized users, enabling manual editing of code that affects
accessibility, e.g. alt tags for images, or ARIA labels.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. Provides an alternative to standard methods of
coding the site, either via source code, web platform templates/CSS
adjustments, etc.</dd>

<dt>Related Topics:</dt>
<dd> This editing needs to be done
by people with expertise. Can be a source of information for a subject matter
expert.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Accessibility editing, by 3rd party</h2>

<p>A third party, via the overlay,
codes the accessibility of the site.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. Without an overlay, this could be an
outsourced remediation team that has login authorization to the source code
and/or admin of the CMS/Platform.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Change Text Size</h2>

<p>Increase or decrease font size, by
clicking an interactive widget.</p>

<p>[2] Source code specifies text
size as per the original target audience and design, but only for content
coming from the source.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Text sizes are configurable in
the operating system. Not clear if this propagates across all dynamically
loaded content.</dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Learning how to make such
changes in browser and/or operating system configurations is challenging for
many, and particularly challenging for the communities that most need it.
Offering overlay access raises awareness that such capabilities are present and
does not prevent users from learning how to configure it in other places.
Overlays are site-specific, making such accomodations on the sites where they
are requested. An overlay could propagate such preferences across sites,
browsers, operating systems and/or devices, to manage the complete experience
including injected and/or dynamic content.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Change Text Spacing</h2>

the browser.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Pause Animations</h2>

<p>The ability to stop animations or
other moving elements on a web page from playing. </p>

<dd> Some players offer a pause.
Context menu or developer tools. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Apply Light Contrast, Dark Contrast, Invert Colors, Color Desaturation</h2>

to people with visual impairments. They modify the difference between the
lightest and darkest parts of a web page, reverse colors, or reduce theior
intensity.</p>

<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Defaults are configurable in
the operating system.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Tooltips</h2>

<p>small pop-up window that appears
on hover to display additional information about an element on the page,
providing context or clarification.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation

</dl>
<h2>Reading Guide</h2>

<p>A horizontal line that appears
below text to help the reader keep their place as they read, follow along with
the text and stay focused. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation

<dd> Defaults are configurable in
the operating system.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Dyslexia Friendly Font </h2>

<p>Fonts considered to be more
dyslexia-friendly as they have more distinctive symbols that avoid confusion,
increased baselines and thinner tops, and a larger x-height. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Fonts can be configured in the
operating system.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Page Structure Show Headings, Links, Landmarks</h2>

<p>ALternative navigation methods
that are commonly used by screen readers, made available to the sighted user.
These include the ability to browse a page by its headings, which can be
helpful for understanding the overall structure of the page; links; buttons. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Available in screen readers</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Reset All</h2>

<p>One button click to reset any user

operating system level and used as a standalone application. Also (less common)
screen readers in an application such as a browser.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>

<p>Enhance visual indicators that
support keyboard navigation such as underlines or color changes; optionally
provide other assistance such as mapping interactive elements to keyboard
shortcuts. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>

unique to overlays of this type. Some aspects can be enhanced in the operating
system or browser configuration, such as focus indication.</dd>
</dl>

<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Some computer vision image
identitification is included in some browser extensions.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Form Labels</h2>

<p>A label associated with each form
field accurately describing its purpose. The label should be consistent with
the logical structure of the form overall.</p>

<p>[2] Code with proper form labels.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Apparently, after twenty years
of consistent effort at changing how we train designers and developers of
forms, only a subset are doing it right today, but we still need the labels.
Having an overlay provide them escalates the need, hopefully attracts dev
attention and gets the resource allocated. Certainly, an overlay does not
prevent source from being fixed, when it can be fixed (e.g. there are some
legacy codebases where fixing in the edge is preferred).</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Dictionary</h2>

<p>Provide definitions of words or
phrases that may be unfamiliar to some users; provide pronunciation guidance;
provide synonyms which can help users with cognitive disabilities better
comprehend the content.</p>
<dl>

<dd> Browsers and operating systems
offer related features, generally on &quot;right-click&quot;. </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Form Validation </h2>

<p>Ensure that screen reader users
and people with disabilities receive clear feedback on the status of the form
along with concise error messages. This includes the colors used, the proximity
to the form field, and the time-sensitive nature of the screen reader
announcement. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Interactive Elements </h2>

<p>Ensure there are concise
instructions and labels that are clear to sighted, low vision and non sighted
users, and that the elements can be controlled with keyboard navigation.
Provide such feedback on the status of the element and any changes that occur. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation unique
to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Autoplay Videos </h2>

<p>Provide ability to pause, mute
and/or stop the video; make these controls keyboard navigation accessible.</p>

<p>[2] Videos should be made
available with these capabilities, as they are built into HTML 5.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. Some sites offer the option. </dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Apparently, after years of
consistent effort at changing how we train designers and developers of websites
that host video, only a subset are doing it right today, and we still need
these controls. Having an overlay deliver these capabilities is not a problem
for end users, it is more service for users. The overlay may escalate the need,
hopefully attracting dev attention and encourage better source development in
the future. Certainly, an overlay does not prevent source from being fixed,
when it can be fixed (e.g. there are some legacy codebases where fixing in the
edge is preferred).</dd>
</dl>
<h2>External Link Targets</h2>

<p>Assure the link is announced
correctly as a link, and inform users if it opens in a new tab or window. In
addition, assess broken links: verify that the link resolves, and mark broken
links as broken. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Ambiguous Links</h2>

<p>Provide descriptive and meaningful
link text that accurately reflects the purpose or destination of the link,
particularly needed for link text such as &quot;click here&quot; or
&quot;more.&quot; </p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Broken Links</h2>

<p>Assess if the link resolves, and
mark broken links as broken.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Redundancy:</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. There are some browser extensions that perform
some of this functionality.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Video Captioning</h2>

<p>Displaying in text along with
video, synchronized with the video, what is heard. </p>

<h2>Missing Titles </h2>

<p>Meaningful titles, for pages and/or
iFrames within pages, allow screen reader users to browse by means of titles. </p>

<h2>Element Focus </h2>

<p>Visible indication when an
interactive element on the page is selected. </p>

<h2>Site Language </h2>

<p>Specify the primary language of a
web page.</p>

marked up sufficiently so that it can be accessed and understood by people with
disabilities, including those who use assistive technology such as a screen
reader.</p>

<h2>Content Moderation</h2>

<p>Assuring that the content on a
site meets content policy. The default policy includes everyday phrases with
racist origins, and gendered or exclusive expressions and terms that are deemed
to exclude audiences.</p>

<h2>Text Align</h2>

<p>Text alignment enhances
readability. The inconsistent spacing between words created by justified text
can be problematic for people with cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. Users
can determine the alignment best suited to their vision.</p>

<h2>Line Height</h2>

<p>Increase or decrease line height
to distinguish between lines of text.</p>

<h2>Accessible Pricing</h2>

<p>Strikethrough pricing is a visual
representation of the original price of a product in a strikethrough or crossed
out font, and then an associatec new price next to it. Screen readers read the
struckout price like any other number, so ARIA markup needs to be added to
indicate that the struck out price is the old, no longer valid price.</p>

<h2>Live Site Translations</h2>

<p>Offer a user-triggered method to
change the language of a web page in real time, by translating the current page
into a language selected by the user.</p>

<h2>Smart Contrast</h2>

<p>The colors of text and background
that does not meet minimum contrast requirements are adjusted in such a way
that the minimum change is made. The advantage of such minimal changes is that
the colors will resemble, or remain close to, the original brand design
intention.</p>
