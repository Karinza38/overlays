<p><b>Accessibility at the Edge Community Group</b></p>

<p><b>Overlay Capabilities Inventory</b></p>

<p>This document describes some capabilities that can be provided by overlays "at the edge", and attempts to answer several questions about them. The questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source: What is the role of the author (or content source code developer) in providing this capability and ensuring that it is accessible.</li>

<li>Tradeoffs When this capability is enabled on the edge, does it potentially duplicate functionality elsewhere in the stack? In particular, we consider all the possibilities near the edge namely the CDN, operating system, user-agent, browser extension, assistive technology, and/or javascript overlay. If so, can (and should) this redundancy be avoided?</li>

<li>Benefit: What is the potential benefit of performing this capability at the edge?</li>

<li>Related topics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDITOR&apos;S NOTE</strong><br /> The <q>Related Items</q> list item is a placeholder to remind us that this document is in active development. Suggestions welcome!</p>
<h1>Capabilities Inventory</h1>

<h2>User-triggered interactions/opt-ins</h2>

<p>User opt-ins via interactive personalization menus: The end-user can access a list of available enhancements and enable those they require. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Users tend to require the same types of accomodations across all sites and all content sources. Therefore, facilitating this capability in the source is likely the least useful place to locate it, because it requires the user to select the same enhancements time and again. </dd>

<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>Many of the capabilities made available by user-triggered opt-ins are often also found in multiple places at the edge. For example, contrast adjustment is generally found  in operating system display settings, in browser and app user-agents (e.g. dark mode/light mode), and in browser extensions, and in javascripted (CDN hosted) overlays. Such redundancy can easily lead to confusion. This confusion may be further exaserbated because certain settings the user finds helpful may be available only in one of these locations, and not in all of them. Furthermore, users are frequently not particularly knowledgeable about their operating system settings menus, especially as these tend to move with each OS revision (to take one example). This can make it difficult to locate these features, especially when we recognize that once satisfactorally configured they are generally not reset (meaning that the user doesn't need to revisit that menu location and soon forgets where it is). On the other hand, locating the accomodation consistently proximate to the user offers the highest likelihood of maximal benefit provided  the accomodation  is easily identified and invoked without conflicts. This also provides the best opportunity for easing the burden of invoking the same accomodation across a user&apos;s multiple devices.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Users can select and optimally tune the types of accomodations that they require. Any device on the edge may also have knowledge of other devices on the edge, that may need the same adjustments, and the edge could propagate these settings to those other devices. MacOS Ventura (MacOS 13.2) is already doing this for wifi passwords when an IOS device configured for the same network is proximate.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Automated Background U-X Processing, no user action invoked</h2>

<p>Users will not care how a functional and accessible experience is assembled as long as their needs are met. However, they are always the ultimate arbiters of whether their needs are being met.
Consequently,
U-X processing should be easily discoverable and defeatable. Users need to be empowered to act should they believe an unmediated experience would be superior. Preserving user agency is simply smart business strategy no matter how excellent the the technology may actually be.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>Content providers have long sought to taylor U-X behavior based on what capabilities could be discovered about the user&apos;s operating environment. What browser is in use? Is a screen reader in use? Indeed, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#recap3">Google&apos;s automated Recaptcha 3 is deeply dependent on just such data gathering</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>Any automated process should give notice that it is running and offer an opt-out, lest users revolt and sponsor resolutions of condemnation in their advocacy organizations. The underlying accessibility principle is <q>Nothing about us without us.</q> Most glaringly, there can be little hope of preserving privacy when content providers are <q>snigginf</q> user data, and monetizing that data. Persons with disabilities tend to be keen on preserving privacy because of perceived and actual discriminatory consequences.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>That capabilities users would desire in general might operate automatically and seemlessly is an accepted technological goal. The error is not in the creation of the automated process, but in leaving the user out of the decision loop. Also, technologically mediated privacy preservation is only feasible in edge technologies, though it can be subverted even there.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Portable cross-site profile expressing accessibility-oriented preferences</h2>

<p>Users now frequently use several devices. Furthermore, users tend to have the same or very similar accessibility requirements regardless of the device they may be using in the moment. It is therefore a goal in web accomodations to support the user in configuring once and having their configured preference propogate across all their devices. This propagation should function across all vendors and operating environments.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>By definition, this cannot be done by the content source.</dd>

<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd>
While generally true and clearly valuable to users, this capability nevertheless requires nuanced implementation. One obvious caveat is screen size and consequent decisions over preferred fonts and backgrounds. Another example nuance is the likely desire of a screen reader user to operate sometimes with TTS , but other times with braille (or both braille and TTS).
</dd>



<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Configure once, deploy everywhere.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Automated Detection of WCAG Violations</h2>

<p>Algorithmic detection of
violations of WCAG 2.x success critera is considered here as a vector for providing the user a more conformant experience. There is, of course, the other application of where violation detection serves as a step in a source remediation process. We address the former here..</p>
<dl>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>By definition, this cannot be done by the content source.</dd>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> In-browser scanners, online scanners
are used to perform detection. This is the business model for many companies. False positives, false negatives; certainty and confidence are well-known factors affecting efficacy. However, the approach provides clear benefits especially in real-time. Immediacy matters. ASR captions may not provide the desired quality, but the alternative may too often be no captions. Similarly missing image descriptions generated by A-I may prove more helpful to the user coping with a substandard page than no alternative text at all. It is unfortunate when these violations remain unremediated. Not only does the continued presence of unremediated content provide user substandard access, it also does not provide A-I engines corrective feedback that could train them to do better in the future.</dd>

<dt>Benefit</dt>
<dd>Something is most often better than nothing, especially in the moment. Pages whose content remains unremediated however, can tend to encourage users to seek alternative source providers.</dd>

<h2>Accessibility editing, by site owner</h2>

<p>An interface in the overlay,
available to authorized users, enabling manual editing of code that affects
accessibility, e.g. alt tags for images, or ARIA labels.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>

<h2>Change Text Size</h2>

<p>Increase or decrease font size, by
clicking an interactive widget.</p>

<p>[2] Source code specifies text

coming from the source.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Text sizes are configurable in
the operating system. Not clear if this propagates across all dynamically
loaded content.</dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Learning how to make such
changes in browser and/or operating system configurations is challenging for
many, and particularly challenging for the communities that most need it.
Offering overlay access raises awareness that such capabilities are present and
does not prevent users from learning how to configure it in other places.
Overlays are site-specific, making such accomodations on the sites where they
are requested. An overlay could propagate such preferences across sites,
browsers, operating systems and/or devices, to manage the complete experience
including injected and/or dynamic content.</dd>

the operating system.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Dyslexia Friendly Font </h2>

<p>Fonts considered to be more
dyslexia-friendly as they have more distinctive symbols that avoid confusion,
increased baselines and thinner tops, and a larger x-height. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Fonts can be configured in the
operating system.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Page Structure Show Headings, Links, Landmarks</h2>

<p>ALternative navigation methods
that are commonly used by screen readers, made available to the sighted user.
These include the ability to browse a page by its headings, which can be
helpful for understanding the overall structure of the page; links; buttons. </p>

support keyboard navigation such as underlines or color changes; optionally
provide other assistance such as mapping interactive elements to keyboard
shortcuts. </p>

<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Some computer vision image
identitification is included in some browser extensions.</dd>

<h2>Form Labels</h2>

<p>A label associated with each form
field accurately describing its purpose. The label should be consistent with
the logical structure of the form overall.</p>

<p>[2] Code with proper form labels.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Apparently, after twenty years
of consistent effort at changing how we train designers and developers of
forms, only a subset are doing it right today, but we still need the labels.
Having an overlay provide them escalates the need, hopefully attracts dev
attention and gets the resource allocated. Certainly, an overlay does not
prevent source from being fixed, when it can be fixed (e.g. there are some
legacy codebases where fixing in the edge is preferred).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Dictionary</h2>

<p>Provide definitions of words or
phrases that may be unfamiliar to some users; provide pronunciation guidance;
provide synonyms which can help users with cognitive disabilities better
comprehend the content.</p>

<dd> Browsers and operating systems
offer related features, generally on &quot;right-click&quot;. </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Form Validation </h2>

<p>Ensure that screen reader users
and people with disabilities receive clear feedback on the status of the form
along with concise error messages. This includes the colors used, the proximity
to the form field, and the time-sensitive nature of the screen reader
announcement. </p>

<h2>Interactive Elements </h2>

<p>Ensure there are concise
instructions and labels that are clear to sighted, low vision and non sighted
users, and that the elements can be controlled with keyboard navigation.
Provide such feedback on the status of the element and any changes that occur. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation unique
to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Autoplay Videos </h2>

<p>Provide ability to pause, mute
and/or stop the video; make these controls keyboard navigation accessible.</p>

<p>[2] Videos should be made
available with these capabilities, as they are built into HTML 5.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. Some sites offer the option. </dd>

<dt>Benefit of being on the Edge:</dt>
<dd> Apparently, after years of
consistent effort at changing how we train designers and developers of websites
that host video, only a subset are doing it right today, and we still need
these controls. Having an overlay deliver these capabilities is not a problem
for end users, it is more service for users. The overlay may escalate the need,
hopefully attracting dev attention and encourage better source development in
the future. Certainly, an overlay does not prevent source from being fixed,
when it can be fixed (e.g. there are some legacy codebases where fixing in the
edge is preferred).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>External Link Targets</h2>

<p>Assure the link is announced
correctly as a link, and inform users if it opens in a new tab or window. In
addition, assess broken links: verify that the link resolves, and mark broken
links as broken. </p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Ambiguous Links</h2>

<p>Provide descriptive and meaningful
link text that accurately reflects the purpose or destination of the link,
particularly needed for link text such as &quot;click here&quot; or
&quot;more.&quot; </p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Broken Links</h2>

<p>Assess if the link resolves, and
mark broken links as broken.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Tradeoffs</dt>
<dd> Not redundant: an innovation
unique to overlays of this type. There are some browser extensions that perform
some of this functionality.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Video Captioning</h2>

<p>Displaying in text along with
video, synchronized with the video, what is heard. </p>

<h2>Missing Titles </h2>

<p>Meaningful titles, for pages and/or
iFrames within pages, allow screen reader users to browse by means of titles. </p>

<h2>Element Focus </h2>

<p>Visible indication when an
interactive element on the page is selected. </p>

<h2>Site Language </h2>

<p>Specify the primary language of a
web page.</p>

<h2>PDF Remediation</h2>

<p>Assuring that a PDF is tagged and
marked up sufficiently so that it can be accessed and understood by people with
disabilities, including those who use assistive technology such as a screen
reader.</p>

<h2>Content Moderation</h2>

<p>Assuring that the content on a
site meets content policy. The default policy includes everyday phrases with
racist origins, and gendered or exclusive expressions and terms that are deemed
to exclude audiences.</p>

<h2>Text Align</h2>

<p>Text alignment enhances
readability. The inconsistent spacing between words created by justified text
can be problematic for people with cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. Users
can determine the alignment best suited to their vision.</p>

<h2>Line Height</h2>

<p>Increase or decrease line height
to distinguish between lines of text.</p>

<h2>Accessible Pricing</h2>

<p>Strikethrough pricing is a visual
representation of the original price of a product in a strikethrough or crossed
out font, and then an associatec new price next to it. Screen readers read the
struckout price like any other number, so ARIA markup needs to be added to
indicate that the struck out price is the old, no longer valid price.</p>

<h2>Live Site Translations</h2>

<p>Offer a user-triggered method to
change the language of a web page in real time, by translating the current page
into a language selected by the user.</p>

<h2>Smart Contrast</h2>

<p>The colors of text and background
that does not meet minimum contrast requirements are adjusted in such a way
that the minimum change is made. The advantage of such minimal changes is that
the colors will resemble, or remain close to, the original brand design
intention.</p>
